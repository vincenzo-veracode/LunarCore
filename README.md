# Running the server and client

### Prerequisites
* [Java 17 JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

### Recommended
* [MongoDB 4.0+](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Compiling the server
1. Download the files from [https://gitlab.com/Melledy/LunarCore-Protos](https://gitlab.com/Melledy/LunarCore-Protos) and place the proto folder into your server directory
2. Open your system terminal, and compile the server with `./gradlew jar`
3. Create a folder named `resources` in your server directory
4. Download the `Config`, `TextMap`, and `ExcelBin` folders from [https://github.com/Dimbreath/StarRailData](https://github.com/Dimbreath/StarRailData) and place them into your resources folder.
5. Download the `Config` folder from [https://gitlab.com/Melledy/LunarCore-Configs](https://gitlab.com/Melledy/LunarCore-Configs) and place them into your resouces folder. REPLACE any files that your system asks about. These are for world spawns and are quite important for the server.
6. Run the server with `java -jar LunarCore.jar` from your system terminal. Lunar Core comes with a built-in internal MongoDB server for its database, so no Mongodb installation is required. However, it is highly recommended to install Mongodb anyway.
7. If you have `autoCreateAccount` set to true in the config, then you can skip creating an account. Otherwise, use the `/account` command in the server console to create one.

### Connecting with the client (Fiddler)
1. **Login with the client to an official server and Hoyoverse account at least once to download game data.**
2. Install and have [Fiddler Classic](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) running.
3. Set fiddler to decrypt https traffic. (Tools -> Options -> HTTPS -> Decrypt HTTPS traffic) Make sure `ignore server certificate errors` is checked as well.
4. Copy and paste the following code into the Fiddlerscript tab of Fiddler Classic:

```
import System;
import System.Windows.Forms;
import Fiddler;
import System.Text.RegularExpressions;

class Handlers
{
    static function OnBeforeRequest(oS: Session) {
        if (oS.host.EndsWith(".starrails.com") || oS.host.EndsWith(".hoyoverse.com") || oS.host.EndsWith(".mihoyo.com") || oS.host.EndsWith(".bhsr.com")) {
            oS.host = "localhost"; // This can also be replaced with another IP address.
        }
    }
};
```

5. Login with your account name, the password can be set to anything.

### Server commands
Server commands can be run in the server console or in-game. There is a dummy user named "Server" in every player's friends list that you can message to use in-game commands.

```
/account {create | delete} [username] (reserved player uid). Creates or deletes an account.
